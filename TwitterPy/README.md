# API
In order to run `TwitterPy.ipynb` you will want to enter your various twitter developer keys into the document `config_sample.py`, then change the name of this file to `config.py`

`TwitterPy.ipynb` utilizes the twitter API and a sentiment analyzer to scrape the 100 most recent tweets of multiple news organizations. These tweets are then run through the sentiment analyzer. The results are then analyzed using several different graphs from matplotlib.
